						<h4><em>CISPA Halted In The Senante</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The Senate is currently working on its own cybersecurity legislation. The Senate's bill (or bills) will not be identical to CISPA so that bill is, in a sense, dead. The new bill by the Senant will likely have a different name, but once the Senate passes its legislation, it can be combined with CISPA, then both chambers approve the compromise bill and send it to the president.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>CISPA is controversial because it overrules all existing federal and state laws by saying: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law," companies may share information "with any other entity, including the federal government." It would not, however, require them to do so. This is relevant because it affects the privacy of every American who accesses the internet. The amount of information that can be shared will dramatically increase, which can threaten the cyber identity of all users.<br />

						<h4><em>New California Bill Would Allow Customers Access to What Companies Know About Them</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>California Assembly Member Bonnie Lowenthal, a representative of the city of Los Angeles, has introduced a bill known as “The Right to Know Act of 2013″ that would compel California-based companies that store customers’ information to share that data with said customer upon request. If they do not comply, the companies can face legal consequences, including a civil suit on behalf of the subject.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>This bill is significant in terms of online privacy. Information is constantly being obtained from all online users, and many people are unaware of the extent of information that is being collected from them.  From the moment a user connects through a web browser, the user’s presence on the internet is being tracked. This bill will most likely bring a greater awareness to the cyber identity of all online users while increasing the regulations companies have when collecting online information. <br />

						<h4><em>Netflix Plans Its Move From Microsoft Silverlight to HTML5 Video</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Currently, Netflix primarily uses the Microsoft Silverlight plug-in when streaming video to web browsers, but Netflix pointed out that the current solution really can't stand. Plug-ins don't play well with with most mobile browsers, they can be cumbersome for users, and perhaps most importantly, Microsoft itself may not develop a new version of Silverlight beyond the current release. HTML5 video is looking like a viable solution.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>Netflix is a major mover within the online industry. They have a large part of the online video steaming market and if they make the move to HTML5 video, the company will help signify the importance of HTML5. With Netflix’s large user base, this move will help solidify the movement towards HTML5, help solidify the important of DRM capabilities, and help solidify the best practices of the web to make the jump to HTML5 standards.<br />

						<h4><em>AT&T announces plans for 1Gbps fiber service in Austin, Texas; Google gets immediate competition</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>AT&T is looking to both overshadow Google's launch party and maintain a foothold in one of its most prized states, the outfit's terse announcement of an impending 1Gbps fiber network should honestly be seen as nothing but excellent news for residents of Austin. Merely hours after Google and the city of Austin jointly made clear that Google Fiber would be hitting up local homes in mid-2014, Ma Bell has made public its "intent" to built a 1 Gigabit fiber network in the same area.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>Less information will be sent between client computers and the webhost servers because of this change in the Firefox browser settings. Ultimately, this will reduce the amount of packets traveing through the online network.Google Fiber is intended to come to Austin in mid-2014, but this competition push by AT&T will only bring more benefits to the online community of Austin. Gigabit fiber services will dramatically increase the online activity in Austin. Upload and Download speeds will be 100x more than they currently are – which will increase the bandwidth, accessibility, and usability of online services in Austin. This kind of online power has limitless benefits and the addition of competition should being more beneficial choices for the internet users of Austin. <br />

						<h4><em>Anonymous Raises $54,798 Through Indiegogo to Kick-Start Its Dedicated News Site For Your Anon News</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>An Indiegogo campaign set up by Anonymous to expand its news coverage through a dedicated site, rather than its existing Twitter and Tumblr services, has closed with over $54,798 in crowd-sourced funding. The news site will be used to bring together breaking news, reports and blogs from independent reporters online under its Your Anon News branding. Anonymous’ original campaign video said that it would provide a space for people on the ground, or ‘citizen journalists’, to be able to livestream events as they were taking place.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>The money the organization has received from 1,309 backers means that it should have more than enough investment to build a news site with considerable influence. This topic is significant with regards to this class because it highlights the fact that many online users support the hacktivist actions of Anonymous – many of which have been questionable in terms of online ethics and principles. Endorsing this organization by so much is questionable to many, and this fundraising could conclude how many people feel about online animosity and privacy.<br />

						<h4><em>World’s Top Supercomputer From ‘09 Is Now Obsolete, Will Be Dismantled</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Five years ago, an IBM-built supercomputer designed to model the decay of the US nuclear weapons arsenal was clocked at speeds no computer in the history of Earth had ever reached. At more than one quadrillion floating point operations per second (that's a million billion, or a "petaflop"), the aptly named Roadrunner was so far ahead of the competition that it earned the #1 slot on the Top 500 supercomputer list in June 2008, November 2008, and one last time in June 2009. Today, that computer has been declared obsolete and it's being taken offline. <br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>
						Even though this supercomputer was directly involved in the historical importance of the cyber world, its takedown is an important event in the over-arching technological world. This computer, which was the fastest in the world 4 years ago, is now no longer relevant compared to today’s online speeds, bandwidth needs, and data requirements. This article emphasizes how fast technology, whether it is for processing applications or supporting the infrastructure of the internet, is changing. Technology is a dynamically evolving entity, and it is easy to forget the internet’s capabilities and uses change along with it.<br />

						<h4><em>Facebook and Youtube Falling in Popularity While Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan Grow Among Teenagers</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>According to Piper Jaffray (PJC), while Facebook and YouTube are still considered the most important social media destination for teens, their popularity among this fickle demographic has fallen precipitously since this time last year, as the chart below indicates.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>It appears that teenagers like to do things online and not get caught. The internet allows the youth to have an outlet where they do not not have to be responsible, and it allows them not get in trouble either. Broadcasting information on Facebook or YouTube can get the authorities and parents involved, so many of today's teenagers are going to Reddit and 4/chan so they can brag about thier actions anonymously. This is relevant in the overall scope of the cyber world because the sharing of content is different among different demographic groups. And the content demanded of the future may be different that what is demanded today.<br />

						<h4><em>Firefox will block third-party cookies in a future version</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Firefox would allow all cookies from sites that a user actively visits, but it would block cookies from third-party sites if a user has not visited that cookie's origin site. Advertisers generally place third-party cookies and can collect data about a user across several websites with them. This is used to serve more targeted ads or refine where an advertising firm should spend its money.<br />

						<h4><em>Susan Crawford on Why U.S. Internet Access is Slow, Costly, and Unfair</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Susan Crawford discusses how our government has allowed a few powerful media conglomerates to put profit ahead of the public interest — rigging the rules, raising prices, and stifling competition. As a result, Crawford says, all of us are at the mercy of the biggest business monopoly since Standard Oil in the first Gilded Age a hundred years ago.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>Americans are paying more for internet access than people in many other countries, and they are getting much less from it as well. The internet is the highway for innovation and information, yet for the country that created the internet, they are surprisingly restricited.<br />

						<h4><em>Telecom Corporations Are Trying To Stop The Government From Offering Free 'Super Wi-Fi'</em></h4>
						<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>There is a new plan to deregulate a small portion of the spectrum and make it available for public use (rather than reserving it for TV stations or giving it to AT&T), which would allow local governments, businesses and crazy hackers to use it for whatever they want. It wouldn't cost the US Government a cent, and there would be no more likelihood of unauthorized surveillance than there is when you use a cell phone.<br />
						<strong>Relevance: </strong>More easily accessible public wi-fi will greatly broaden cyberspace and help keep the nation streamlined and economically relevant in the coming decades.<br />
