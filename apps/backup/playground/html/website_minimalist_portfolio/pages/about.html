	<p>I am a 23 year old graduate from the University of Texas at Austin with a BBA in Management Information Systems and a minor in Computer Science. This website is my development playground - where I will document, showcase, provide status updates, and play around with all things new happening on the web. As of right now, the site is not much as it is only a couple days olds, but I have big plans for it so it will evolve and become better with time.</p>
